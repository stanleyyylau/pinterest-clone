Another FCC Project

To make things simple, decided to switch this from SPA to server side render
So I can easly this this on gomix, doing this because there's a bug with twitter login
sometime it doesnt work with local machine, has to put the code on production server

## V2
User should be able to login via twitter and logout

## V3
User should be about to post new pin and gets redirect to home

## V4 (No need to implement)
User should be about to *like* a pin

## V5
Authenticated user should to able to see all his pins and delete them

## V6
Anyone can see anyone's pins

## V7
Broken image should be automatically replaced
